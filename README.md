This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Title

Welcome to Fact Fun!

## Motivation
Quite simply, whe discovered the CIA World Factbook API and thought, "how can we *not* use this!?" It was extra fun too, because as part of our entrance exam we had to pass an infamous exercise known as "Hashketball", and the JSON data was so deeply nested this felt like "Hasketball 2!"

## Build Status
Fact fun is likely in its final state. 

## Code Style
Indentation.

## Frameworks
This app uses vanilla Javascript

## Installation
Simply open test.html to access the game.  

## How to use
When you've opened test.html, either sign up or log in. Once you're logged in, you can play the game! Read over the facts presented, and click the one of four presented countries you believe is the country being described. If you're right, you get points! If not, you don't! Either way, it's fun!
