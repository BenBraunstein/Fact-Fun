This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Title

Welcome to Fact Fun!

## Motivation
Quite simply, whe discovered the CIA World Factbook API and thought, "how can we *not* use this!?" It was extra fun too, because as part of our entrance exam we had to pass an infamous exercise known as "Hashketball", and the JSON data was so deeply nested this felt like "Hasketball 2!"

## Build Status
Fact fun is likely in its final state. 

## Code Style
Indentation.

## Frameworks
This app uses React, Redux, and Redux-Thunk on the front end and Rails API with a Postgres database on the back end. 

## Installation
Simply open test.html to access the game.  

## How to use
Making use of the project is quite easy. Viewable to everyone is a home page with all rulesets that have been flagged as "published." Clicking on any rulseset with take you to an index of that rulesets component chapters. Click on any one of them to view that chapter of the rules. If you would like to view the entire ruleset as one contigous document, hit "export" and you will be offered a complete PDF of the rules for download. If the user wishes to create or edit their own games, they may sign up log in (at current there is only one hard coded user who is auto logged in, but this will change soon), and then have access to an index of personal games. It is presented much the same as the index of public games, except with increased functionality.
